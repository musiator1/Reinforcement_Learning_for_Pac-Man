# Reinforcement_Learning_for_Pac-Man
Implementing Pac-Man game and then using RL to complete the game.

To test the code u have to download all code and run proper files. There are 3 functionalities:
* **normal pacman game without ai** - to play pacman using arrows run the ``pacman_game/src/game_main.py`` file
* **watching process of training** - to watch pacman becoming smarter run the ``pacman_game_ai_/src/agent.py`` file
* **watching trained pacman** - to watch trained pacman run the ``pacman_game_ai_/src/trained_agent.py`` file.
